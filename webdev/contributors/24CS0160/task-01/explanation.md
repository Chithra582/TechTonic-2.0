What I understood from this task
            The task was to design a responsive landing page using only HTML and CSS, without 
using any frameworks. The main goal was to create a clean layout with proper sections and a modern look.


How I implemented the solution
             I used HTML to structure the page into sections like navigation, hero, features, and footer. 
I used Flexbox and Grid in CSS because they make alignment easier and help in creating responsive layouts.


What I learned from this task
             I learned how to build a complete webpage using only HTML and CSS, improve responsiveness, 
and use animations and hover effects properly.


What is good about my solution
             The code is well-organized, easy to read, and the design works well on different screen 
sizes. The layout looks modern and clean.


What could be improved / felt difficult
             Handling responsiveness for smaller screens was a bit challenging. With more time, I could 
improve spacing and accessibility.
